##  Naive Bayes

This is Assignment 3 for Naive Bayes Classifier.


```{r bank}
library("readr")
library("caret")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("reshape2")
library("e1071")
rm(list=ls())
bank <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\madhu\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\MS\\1stSem\\2.Fundamentals of ML\\Modules\\Mod4\\Assignment\\Bank.csv")
bank$Personal.Loan <- as.factor(bank$Personal.Loan
bank$Online <- as.factor(bank$Online)
bank$forexcard <- as.factor(bank$forexcard)
set.seed(64060)
train_set = createDataPartition(bank$Personal.Loan, p=.6, list = F) #60% train
train_df = bank[train_index,]
validation_df = bank[-train_index,]
```

1. Create a pivot table for the training data with Online as a column variable, CC as a row variable, and Loan as a secondary row variable. The values inside the table should convey the count. In R use functions melt() and cast(), or function table()

```{r pivot}
melt_bank = melt(train_df, id=c("forexcard","Personal.Loan"), variable = "Online") # elongated DF to reshape id, var into $value 
dcast_bank = dcast(melt_bank, forexcard+Personal.Loan~Online)
dcast_bank[,c(1:2,14)] # forexcard, Personal.Loan, Online DF
```

2. Consider the task of classifying a customer who owns a bank credit card and is actively using online banking services. Looking at the pivot table, what is the probability that this customer will accept the loan offer? [This is the probability of loan acceptance (Loan = 1) conditional on having a bank credit card (CC = 1) and being an active user of online banking services (Online = 1)].

the probability that this customer will accept the loan :: 93/3000=3.1%

3. Create two separate pivot tables for the training data. One will have Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns) and the other will have Loan (rows) as a function of CC.

```{r pivotTables}
loan_melt_bank = melt(train_df, id=c("Personal.Loan"), variable = "Online")
cc_melt_bank = melt(train_df, id=c("forexcard"), variable = "Online")
dcast_loan_bank = dcast(loan_melt_bank, Personal.Loan~Online)
dcast_cc_bank = dcast(cc_melt_bank, forexcard~Online)
dcast_loan_bank[,c(1,13)]
dcast_cc_bank[,c(1,14)]
```

4. Compute the following quantities [P(A | B) means "the probability ofA given B"]: 

I. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors)
93/(93+195) = 32.29%
```{r loanAcceptors}
table(train_df[,c(14,10)])
```
II. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1)
179/(179+109) = 62.15%
```{r subtask2}
table(train_df[,c(13,10)])
```
III. P(Loan = 1)
288/(288+2712) = 9.6%
```{r subtask3}
table(train_df[c(10)])
```
IV.  P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) 
788/(788+1924) = 29% 

V. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0)
1631/(1631+1081) = 60%

VI. P(Loan = 0)
2712/(2712+288) = 90.4% 

5. Use the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)

((93/(93+195))* (179/(179+109))* (288/(288+2712)))/((93/(93+195))* (179/(179+109))* (288/(288+2712))) + ((788/(788+1924)) * (1631/(1631+1081)) * (2712/(2712+288))) = 0.1087106


6. Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more accurate estimate?

0.1 nearly same as calculated method in 5th answer. The calculated method needed independent variable to predict, where as Naive Bayes not needed the independent variable.


7. Which of the entries in this table are needed for computing P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)? Run naive Bayes on the data. Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry that corresponds to P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1). Compare this to the number you obtained in (E).

```{r naivebayes}
train_nb = train_df[,c(10,13:14)]
nb = naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~., data=train_nb)
nb
```

(0.32 * 0.62 * 0.09) / (0.32 * 0.62 * 0.09) + (0.29 * 0.60 * 0.90)  = 0.098

We received the nearly same out put for Naive Bayes in above.
