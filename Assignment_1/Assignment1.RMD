## Bikes Dataset

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
install.packages(readr)
library(readr)
bikes<-read.csv(file='BIKE DETAILS.csv')


```

## Print
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


print(bikes$name)
print(bikes$selling_price)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


plot(bikes$year)
plot(bikes$selling_price)


```

## Including Plots with Transformation

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(bikes$seller_type)
summary(bikes$selling_price)

table(bikes$name)
table(bikes$seller_type)
```

## Including scatter Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")


library(ggplot2)
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=name, y=selling_price)) + geom_point()



```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
